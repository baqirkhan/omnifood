# Omnifood.dev

This project is a part of a udemy course [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS
](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3), where, I wrote the code before
watching the lecture, using reference of the already created website of [Omnifood](https://omnifood.dev/) and then
comparing with the instructor's code and modifying if necessary. All the commits with the keyword `self` in it are my
efforts of building the site.

This project helped me understand:

1. Basic concepts of HTML/CSS
2. Intermediate concepts of flexbox
3. Intermediate concepts of CSS Grid
4. Website design personalities
5. Multiple tools and techniques used for building modern sites

This project is one of the many that I will build as part of becoming a full stack developer and this project has set an
amazing base for what is to come next.

Although, this is a learning project, but please feel free to add any suggestions or bug fixes.
